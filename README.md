AI project
This program uses OpenCV and a hand detector to track hand movements and control the mouse based on the hand's position. 
A webcam is set up to capture video, and the hand detector identifies the hand's location, drawing a circle around its center.
Specific finger gestures trigger commands like volume up, volume down, or click actions. The state of the fingers is displayed on the screen.
The program can be exited by pressing the 'q' key.
